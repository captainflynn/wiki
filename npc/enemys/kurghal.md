In my research to the draconic pantheon, I have found an interesting part of their creation myth. It speaks of an ancient evil that almost destroyed our world. But was stopped by seven guardians.
When the All-father created Oraxis he tasked Bahamut to create guardians to protect the realm. And so Bahamut created seven metallic dragons from the metals of Oraxis.

* From copper came Oddrunth
* From Iron Rose Ighas
* From bronze, ascended Gondar
* Arleth and Orthax were molded from Silver
* Jinlong was forged from gold
* Othir was pulled from cobalt

The dragons protected Oraxis from the greater evils for thousands of years.
Until Tiamat, Bahamutâ€™s sister, became jealous, she also created seven dragons in her image.

* From her anger came Umman
* From her jealousy came Zugho
* From her hatred came Bradra
* From her bitterness came Evrit
* From her shadow came Ziemere
* From her greed came Modguhl
* From her magic came Harmontir

These seven chromatic dragons did battle with the seven metallic dragons on many occasions, but were never able to defeat them.
> The chromatic dragons used ancient magic to combine
their powers, but it backfired and they were
transformed into a twisted creature. In their new
form, they became known as Kurghal.
Tiamat afraid of the power Kurghal
attained, retreated back into the nine hells.

The next part of the myth is not very clear to me, it
differs per region of the world, and there is no concise
series of events, but it does all end in the same way.
