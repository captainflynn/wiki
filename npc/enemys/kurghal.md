In my research to the draconic pantheon, I have found an interesting part of their creation myth. It speaks of an ancient evil that almost destroyed our world. But was stopped by seven guardians.
When the All-father created Oraxis he tasked Bahamut to create guardians to protect the realm. And so Bahamut created seven metallic dragons from the metals of Oraxis.
